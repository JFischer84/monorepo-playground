# TODO

- break creator in multiple components and test them separately 
- use bootstrap navbar for nav items
- Use mixins for ProgressBar
- Write Test for pages/index.tsx
  - test shallow general and snapshot for detailed
- Find a way to test store.ts
- validate input on creator
- Add missing components to creator
- Save to indexedDB (upload for Picture (blob), import JSon)
- API Call (for Picture?) with Ajax/Axios (inject credentials via Vercel)
- (Set MyCV Folder in Vercel instead of root) << seems to be solved
- Maybe: Use Request Animation Frame to solve Accordion issue
- Maybe: Dark Mode
